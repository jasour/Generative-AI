# Generative AI Foundations: Algorithms and Architectures

*[Ashkan Jasour](https://ajasour.com)*


“Generative AI Foundations: Algorithms and Architectures” offers a comprehensive and technical guide to modern generative modeling. It introduces fundamental principles, key algorithms—such as flow models, diffusion models, VAEs, GANs, and autoregressive models—and the neural architectures—such as CNNs, U-Nets, Transformers, and multimodal frameworks—that power state-of-the-art generative AI systems. The course balances mathematical depth with conceptual clarity, presenting precise formulations of modeling goals, corresponding training objectives, and the architectures that realize them.
